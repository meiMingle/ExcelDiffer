# ExcelDiffer
This is a plugin for Excel file. You can compare the contents of two Excel files in IDEs. Three formats of [xls, xlsx, csv] are supported.

# Usage
Click to select a file (the suffix is XLS or CSV or xlsx), and then right-click to select Add to Exceldiffer -> Left. 

Then select another file, right-click and select Add to Exceldiffer -> Right to automatically load the file contents 
and display the comparison results.

The upper right corner of the interface shows the comparison results, and the upper left corner is the operation area, 
which can jump between different results.

The bottom of the interface shows the comparison results of the two lines, and the vertical comparison is clearer.
